autowrapt
=========

A Python module for triggering monkey patching of a Python application,
without the need to actually modify the Python application itself to
setup the monkey patches.

The package works in conjunction with the ``wrapt`` module. One would
create post import hook patch modules per ``wrapt`` module requirements,
and then list the names of the setuptools entrypoints you wish to activate
in the ``AUTOWRAPT_BOOTSTRAP`` environment variable, when executing Python
within the environment that the ``autowrapt`` module is installed.

To understand what is possible, a set of examples is also installed with
this package. To see the examples in action run the following::

    AUTOWRAPT_BOOTSTRAP=autowrapt.examples python

At the Python interpreter prompt then enter::

    import this

This should print out the Zen of Python as normal, but with an extra line
added to the end.

For the monkey patching of sklearn with afsklearn set the following::

    AUTOWRAPT_BOOTSTRAP=afsklearn python
